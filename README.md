# NovaTalk

NovaTalk is a lightweight self-hosted chat platform built with Flask, SQLAlchemy, and Flask-SocketIO.
 Itâ€™s designed to feel familiar and modern â€” a clean, Material Design 3 interface, smooth animations, and a focused three-column messenger layout.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Material Design 3** interface with light/dark themes that adapt smoothly

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Docker

(Under development)



### Development Server

### 1. Install dependencies

```
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the setup wizard

```
python setup.py
```

Provide your MySQL connection details, an uploads directory, and the credentials for the first administrator account. The wizard creates a `.env` file and initialises the database schema.

### 3. Launch NovaTalk (Production Server under development, currently only tested on the development server)

```
python app.py
```

The application defaults to `http://localhost:5000`.

## Administrative CLI

NovaTalk ships with a Click-based management tool for user administration.

Create a user:

```
python cli.py add-user --username alice --email alice@example.com --password S3cureP@ss --display-name "Alice Johnson"
```

Reset a password:

```
python cli.py set-password --username alice --password N3wSecret!
```

All commands run inside the Flask application context and persist changes via SQLAlchemy with Werkzeug-secured hashes.

For more CLI usages, please refer to [CLI Documents](docs/cli.md).

## Environment variables

- `SECRET_KEY` â€“ Flask secret key (generated during setup)

- `DATABASE_URL` â€“ SQLAlchemy connection string, e.g. `mysql+pymysql://user:password@localhost:3306/novatalk`

- `UPLOAD_FOLDER` â€“ Absolute path where avatars and message images will be stored

  (Check .env file)

## Development notes

- The interface uses Material Web typography, elevation, and ripples with custom CSS tailored for NovaTalk.
- Real-time messaging uses Flask-SocketIO with eventlet. Ensure eventlet is installed and use `socketio.run` in production.
- File uploads are validated for image type and size and stored within `UPLOAD_FOLDER`.
- To create migrations, run `flask db init`, `flask db migrate`, and `flask db upgrade` after setting `FLASK_APP=app:create_app`.
